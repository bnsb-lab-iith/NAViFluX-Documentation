# Model Builder

The **Model Builder** is an interactive tool designed to help you create models from scratch.  

It supports creating new reactions, merging multiple canvases, filling missing elements, and deleting unwanted reactions.  
Users can also export models into various formats including SBML, JSON, Cytoscape files, edge lists, and images.


!!! tip "Recommended"
    It is highly advised to check out [Pathway Visualizer](./visualizer.md) first and then proceed to **Model Builder** as the core logic of model editing and enrichment of reactions remains the same.
