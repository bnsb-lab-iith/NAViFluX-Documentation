# Upload File

To get started with the App, you can use the Upload Files Dropdown to choose an option. The **Upload File** feature lets you import existing **metabolic pathway models** into the pathway visualizer. This means you can immediately begin **analyzing, editing, and exploring pathways** without rebuilding them manually.
