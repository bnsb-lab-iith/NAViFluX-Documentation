### **Step to merge canvases**
- Click the **Merge Canvas** button to start merging. 
- Next, you are prompted to select two canvases in order. **The selection is indicated by a green outline around the canvas**
- Once both the canvases are selected, click the same merge button (Now named **Merge selected Canvas**) to complete merging

!!! tip "Preservation of layouts"
    Each canvas is associated with a certain layout/orientation. Once the merge has been completed, the layout positions will be retained in the merged canvas.

The Undo Merge feature will help you revert back to the original two canvases before merging
